Geek's diary keeper, currently in pre-alpha state :)

## Why would a grown person keep a diary?

*   The ability to recall why a particular time of your life was worth living is crucial for your
    long term happiness. Can you recall what you did during this week four years ago? If you can't,
    it doesn't mean the week was not worth living, but it does mean that you can't derive a feeling
    of happiness and satisfaction from knowing *why* it was worth living. Keeping a diary helps you
    recall. You won't lose memories that are worth keeping.

*   A diary helps you reflect on how you spent your time. In the long run, keeping a diary increases
    your ability to recognize what's really important for you, what makes you happy. You will be
    able to shape your days to contain more of those happy moments and important stuff. You will
    be able to point your life in a direction that will bring you satisfaction and happiness.

The project was ignited by Radovan Bahbouh's inspiring TEDx talk "The Best Investment"

## Tips

*   At the end of the day, try to recall what important things happened. Recall why this day was
    worth living. Write it down.

*   Do not write just what happened, write also how you felt about it.
